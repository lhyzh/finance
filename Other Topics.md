### Increasing during Oct. 2019

Those include the Federal Reserve’s cuts to short-term interest rates, steps toward a trade agreement by the U.S. and China and a series of economic reports that turned out better than some investors had feared.

Some investors say the rise of 10-year yieldsabove three-month yields is a positive sign forthe economy.

Yields on longer-term Treasurys also slipped below shorter-term yields, a phenomenon known as an inverted yield-curve, which has proved one of the financial markets’ best predictors of a looming recession.

The 10-year yield remains very low—sitting closer to the all-time low of 1.366% it reached in 2016 than the 3.2% level it briefly hit about a year ago when the Fed was still raising interest rates.

Nonetheless, many investors think yields have room to rise as more people sell bonds to buy riskier assets.

- a trade agreement by the U.S. and China
