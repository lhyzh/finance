## Phase 1 Deal？

rollback

high tech

more agricultural products import

open investment

## Reasons 

###Cycle

10 years weak, 6 years strong

since 1971 without the relationship with gold

1981 **Falkland Islands** war till 1986

then weak though Janpan

1997 Thailand Financial Crisis to Asian Area

2002 districtional crisis maker?

2008 financial crisis, mortgage really hurts united states, so the weak time is long

2015 till now South China Sea Hong Kong Problem and Trade War

###Good timing

14 QE $\to$ FX Reserve increasing

China 4 trillion CNY save the market then the higher price in real estate market, highly debt for young especially, and great trade war for United States

reduce the FX Reserve; keep the status of dollars

## Unemployment rate

Since end of Financial Crisis in 2010, unemployment rate kept decreasing. Maybe not from the tariff, Sep 3.5% Oct 3.6%

### short term

domestic producer: + receive more orders from local; foreign producers higher cost; lead to more employment of workers

foreign producer: - higher cost on material, less profit, less work

### long term

foreign country retaliate $\to$ more cost, export producer down, economic growth down, create more layoffs, not less

## Consumers

###US

China is global supply chain, biggest manufacting hub

American companies need Chinese factory, so hurt more on American

Spend 1 dollar, 0.55 dollar will be back to america

Hurt may not feel but exist to America consumers

Cost $\to$ producer $\to$ consumer need time to feel the war during supply chain

###China

For China, the same problem 0.55 vs 1 at least

decrease in some province, but not all

## Conclusion

It's good time for trade war, but not good results for United States (till now)

Both of them are trying to delay the war into a long-term war

China needs time for development, US needs time for operation.
